    "# 10_Bean_Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding **when** and **how** beans are initialized is key to writing efficient, scalable Spring Boot applications. Let’s explore everything you need to know about **bean initialization** with examples, concepts, and emojis! 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 What is Bean Initialization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bean Initialization is the process where Spring creates objects (beans) and manages their lifecycle in the **ApplicationContext**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 1. Eager (Early) Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 2. Lazy Initialization (on-demand)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 1) Eager (Early) Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, **Spring initializes all singleton beans eagerly** during application startup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as the `ApplicationContext` is created, Spring instantiates all `@Bean`, `@Component`, `@Service`, and `@Repository` annotated classes **immediately**.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Advantage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ready-to-use beans at runtime 🏁\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Disadvantage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Slower startup time ⏱️ (especially if you have many beans)\n",
    "* Unused beans may still be created, wasting memory 💸\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 Example: Eager Bean\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Service\n",
    "public class OrderService {\n",
    "    public OrderService() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"OrderService Initialized Eagerly 🚀\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 As soon as the app starts, you’ll see the message printed — even if `OrderService` is never used!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 2) Lazy Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "With **lazy initialization**, Spring will delay the creation of the bean **until it's actually requested** for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 How to use Lazy Initialization?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Option A: At Bean Level\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Component\n",
    "@Lazy\n",
    "public class PaymentService {\n",
    "    public PaymentService() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"PaymentService Initialized Lazily 🐢\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Option B: At Configuration Level\n",
    "\n",
    "Enable lazy init globally for all beans:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@SpringBootApplication\n",
    "@EnableLazyInitialization\n",
    "public class StoreApplication {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        SpringApplication.run(StoreApplication.class, args);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or using `application.properties`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```properties\n",
    "spring.main.lazy-initialization=true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Example Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Service\n",
    "@Lazy\n",
    "public class StripePaymentService {\n",
    "    public StripePaymentService() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"StripePaymentService created 🐢\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@RestController\n",
    "public class PaymentController {\n",
    "    @Autowired\n",
    "    private StripePaymentService paymentService;\n",
    "\n",
    "    @GetMapping(\"/pay\")\n",
    "    public String pay() {\n",
    "        paymentService.processPayment(100);\n",
    "        return \"Payment done!\";\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 The message appears **only when** you visit `/pay` in your browser!\n",

    "## 🎯 When to Use What?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Use **eager init** for essential beans required at startup.\n",
    "✅ Use **lazy init** for heavy objects that may not be needed immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏁 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spring initializes all singleton beans **eagerly** by default\n",
    "* Use `@Lazy` to initialize beans **only when needed**\n",
    "* Helps optimize performance and memory usage\n",
    "* Can apply globally or per-bean\n"
