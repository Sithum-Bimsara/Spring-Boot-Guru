    "1. Bean Instantiation ✨\n",
    "2. Dependency Injection 🧩\n",
    "3. Initialization ✅\n",
    "4. Use / Active State 🏃\n",

    "\n",
    "### ✅ `@PostConstruct`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Runs **after** the bean is created and dependencies are injected\n",
    "* Great for: initialization logic, validation, setting up connections\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧹 `@PreDestroy`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Runs **before** the bean is destroyed\n",
    "* Great for: closing resources, releasing connections, cleanup\n",
