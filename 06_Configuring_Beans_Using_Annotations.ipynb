    "Spring Boot uses **component scanning** to find classes annotated with `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc., and adds them to the **ApplicationContext**.\n",
    "\n",

    "```java\n",
    "@Autowired\n",

    "‚úÖ Spring injects beans automatically based on interfaces\n",

    "‚úÖ `ApplicationContext` lets you get beans manually\n",

    "‚úÖ Easy to swap implementations without changing business logic (Open/Closed Principle!)\n",
