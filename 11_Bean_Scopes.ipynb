    "# 11_Bean_Scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Spring Boot, the **scope** of a bean defines **how long a bean lives** and **how many instances** of that bean Spring will create. Understanding bean scopes is essential for writing correct and optimized applications! 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 What is a Bean Scope?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **bean scope** determines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🔄 How often a new object of that bean is created\n",
    "* 🧠 How Spring manages its lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 Types of Bean Scopes in Spring\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Singleton (Default)\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ Only **one instance** of the bean is created\n",
    "* ♻️ Shared across the entire Spring container\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Component\n",
    "public class SingletonBean {\n",
    "    public SingletonBean() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Singleton Bean Initialized 🧠\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Even if you inject this bean multiple times, **only one object** is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "🟢 Best for: stateless services, shared resources\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🆕 A **new bean instance** is created **each time** it's requested\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Component\n",
    "@Scope(\"prototype\")\n",
    "public class PrototypeBean {\n",
    "    public PrototypeBean() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Prototype Bean Created 🧪\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Every time you use `ApplicationContext.getBean(PrototypeBean.class)`, you get a new instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "🟡 Best for: stateful or temporary objects\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Request (Web-specific)\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🌐 A new bean is created for every **HTTP request**\n",
    "* Bean is discarded after the request ends\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Component\n",
    "@Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_REQUEST)\n",
    "public class RequestScopedBean {\n",
    "    public RequestScopedBean() {\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 You need to use this in a **Spring MVC web app**\n",
    "\n",
    "🟠 Best for: user-specific request data, temporary request storage\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ Session (Web-specific)\n",
    "\n",
    "* 💾 One bean instance per **user session** (across multiple requests)\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Component\n",
    "@Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION)\n",
    "public class SessionScopedBean {\n",
    "    public SessionScopedBean() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Session Scoped Bean Created 🧰\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 New bean created once per HTTP session and reused until session ends\n",

    "## 💡 How to Specify Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `@Scope` annotation along with `@Component` or `@Bean`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Scope(\"prototype\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or for web scopes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **singleton** whenever possible (default)\n",
    "* Use **prototype** when you need unique instances\n",
    "* Use **request/session** only in **web apps** and for **short-lived state**\n",
